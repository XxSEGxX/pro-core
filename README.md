1. The fall of Shiganshina

Attack on the Titans begins its story by declaring humanity an endangered species. For over a hundred years, they have lived in fear of the Titans, a race of humanoid beings with predatory characteristics, who roam this universe looking for people to devour.

No human being seems to know much more about the Titans or their origins, and the humanity that has survived them has barricaded itself inside gigantic walls, creating small metropolis sheltered from these beings.

Life inside these walls seems to be peaceful, but for Eren Jaeger, our protagonist, it is boring. Eren wants to fight for humanity, to live an unparalleled adventure that will give him the freedom he longs for. For this reason, he wishes to join the militia corps that is dedicated to go outside the walls and exterminate titans to study them and learn more about them.

Eren lives inside Shiganshina, a small town that shelters him, his mother and his two best friends. Armin Arlert, an intelligent boy who is constantly teased by his classmates for having different beliefs, and Mikasa Ackerman, a girl whom Eren's family adopted when she was just a child. Mikasa, meanwhile, is strong, quick and agile, terrifying when she gets angry.

Peace in Shiganshina is compromised when a colossal titan that has never been seen before destroys the walls and forces the inhabitants to move inland or become refugees. In the frenzy of the attack, Eren and Mikasa discover that their home has been crushed by a boulder, and Eren's mother has suffered severe injuries that prevent her from walking.

In a desperate attempt to save her, a soldier friend of the family, Hanness, tries to confront the titan, only to realize that his skills in these years of peace are not enough. Desperate to save at least the children's lives, he takes Eren and Mikasa in his arms, fleeing the scene and leaving Eren's mother behind.

The tragedy continues, and Eren witnesses a titan devour his mother.

After these events, the famine within the metropolis is such that a quarter of a million people are exiled outside the walls. Among these exiles is Armin's grandfather, who was the trio's only remaining guardian. Due to this series of events that leaves them orphaned, Eren, Armin and Mikasa decide to join the militia to reclaim what is left of their world.

2. The Battle of Trost

After enlisting in the militia, we meet the rest of Eren's cadets and companions, Mikasa and Armin, the supporting cast of the series.

However, the tranquility doesn't last long. Shortly after graduation, the titans prepare another offensive, again led by the colossal titan. Despite the unit's years of training, these titans remain a huge threat, and the group is decimated in no time.

In a desperate attempt to save Armin's life, Eren is wounded in battle by a titan, dismembered and soon after devoured, but that is not the end of the story of our protagonist.

During his agony, Eren discovers that, by drawing blood in a moment of rage, he can become a Titan. In a stupor, Eren uses his Titan form to decimate the others and give the cadets another chance, before returning to his human form, tired and unconscious.

This logically results in terror and distrust on the part of the military who witnessed the act, but Eren comes out of the interrogations with flying colors, offering his services as a titan to be used in battle.

Eren, fearful of making mistakes in fulfilling the mission of sealing the hole in the Rose wall, requests the support of the elite reconnaissance troops. This is a team of expert soldiers with the skills to explore the world outside the walls.

The leader of this military force is Captain Levi, a soldier with exceptional skills who is very enigmatic and does not trust Eren. In addition, they also work with Hange Zoë, a doctor who has a morbid fascination with titans and is dedicated to studying them.

After a massive effort by all involved, Eren manages to plug the hole in the wall, but not before going mad and almost killing Mikasa. From this, we can conclude that Eren is not able to control himself at all when he is transformed into a Titan.

Shortly after the battle of Trost, Eren is put on trial where it is established that he will only survive under the supervision of the recon troops. He happily joins Levi and Hange in the most lethal branch of the militia, hoping to be trained by them to control his mental state once transformed into a Titan.

Many of his colleagues join him in this decision - including, obviously, Armin and Mikasa - joining the regime to continue this battle against the greatest threat to humanity.

3. The female titan

During Eren's training they discover that Hange is studying two titans, nicknamed Sawney and Beane. However, an unknown traitor murders Sawney and Beane to prevent further study and escapes to the area outside the walls.

To uncover the traitor, the protagonists go on an expedition in search of the truth about his nature; which Eren believes is buried in Shiganshina, in the basement of his house. Unfortunately, they don't get very far: they discover a female titan who is ready to kill them all in cold blood.

After demonstrating that she has incredible human intelligence, the militia concludes that she must be a human transformed into a titan like Eren.

The exploration regime suffers countless losses to reduce this titan, but all in vain: he has the ability to transform his skin into an organic crystal that protects his weak point.

Mikasa and Levi try to wear it down, but even with the intervention of Eren in titan form, they are unable to capture it, resulting in many more human losses.

As Eren recovers from defeat, Armin and Mikasa begin to speculate on who the female titan might be, and prepare a plan together with the 104th division to bring her out of hiding. To carry out their plan, they use Eren as bait, simulating a discharge from intensive care.

As it turns out, the female titan is none other than Annie Leonheart, a secretive and quiet fellow cadet. Annie confesses, but reveals no further information before fighting a frenzied battle against Eren and the others.

In her titan form, Annie destroys the capital behind the Sina wall, but the cadets manage to stop her so that Eren confronts her again.

At the moment of giving her the final blow, Eren hesitates, and Annie surrounds her body in the organic crystal she produces, forcing the military to take her into custody without any way to question her.

The first season ends full of uncertainty, as it is unknown which humans can transform into titans and whether they are infiltrated into the military. Unlike Eren, they might not be in favor of humanity.

However, he cannot leave without leaving us with one last surprise: the last scene reveals an area of the main wall falling down where, inside the wall, there is none other than a titan.

Titans not only live outside the walls, but they also seem to live inside them.

4. The titan beast

The second season of Attack on the Titans picks up right where the first season ended. Hange Zoë interrogates Pastor Nick, a member of the Cult of the Walls church, to find out why there are titans inside the walls.

However, before making any progress, the cadets of the 104th division encounter another crisis: the Rose wall has fallen, and there are titans on their way south.

All members of the militia race to inform the nearest neighbors, but Miche Zackarius has a lethal encounter with the new titan enemy, a hairy giant far more cunning than any other titan.

After the arrival of the new group of titans, Eren, Armin, Mikasa, Levi and Hange try to uncover the conspiracy behind the titans in the walls. Sasha returns to her old home and after a scary encounter with a titan, she manages to get out alive.

On the other hand, Conny returns to her old village, Rakago, and finds it destroyed. The house she shared with her family is in ruins, crushed under a titan. The curious thing, is that Conny finds said titan strangely familiar, and after their encounter, the Titan responds to her greeting, and we discover that the creature looks like a titan version of her mother.

Again the question arises, where did the titans come from?

5. Christa and Ymir

After the surviving cadets regroup and look for a place to block the entrance of the Rose Wall titans, we can discover the story of other characters that have not been explored.

We begin with Ymir. Many years ago, Ymir lived in a distant village, and seemed to be the object of devotion of a cult. When the cult members are caught and punished by the authorities, they are punished using a mysterious injection and then left to fend for themselves in the forest.

Years later, Ymir and Christa meet as cadets during brutal training in the dead of winter, and begin to develop a close friendship.

Ymir is one of the few people who knows an important secret about Christa: the girl is a member of the real royal family, and her real name is Historia Reiss. During this exercise, Ymir and Christa make a promise to take care of each other. Ymir adds that when the time is right, he will reveal his biggest secret to Christa.

In the present, Ymir and Christa find themselves trapped in an abandoned castle after finding no hole in the Rose wall. Without warning, the beast titan launches an offensive, and sends several titans to attack them. Despite their efforts to put up a fight, they end up cornered.

Putting Christa's life as a priority, Ymir makes an unexpected sacrifice. She cuts off her hand with a knife, turning herself into a titan, attacking the others and defending the military regiment in the process.

That injection she received as a child transformed her into a Titan capable of becoming human again, just like Annie and Eren. Originally, Ymir had spent 60 years wandering the earth as a titan, but eventually regained her humanity, and is willing to use her powers to protect a woman who seems to own her affections.

6. Bertholdt and Reiner

After our protagonist trio is reunited with the rest of their companions in the battle of Utgard Castle, their happiness is short-lived. Immediately, suspicions grow among friends, once it is discovered that Ymir was a titan.

Shepherd Nick warned Hange that Christa was the key to the titans inside the walls, and the fact that they found no holes in the wall makes them think that there are traitors among the humans.

It is finally abruptly discovered that Reiner and Bertholdt are the armored and colossal titan, respectively, when Reiner accosts Eren and tells him to leave with them to avoid more massacres.

Eren, understandably, does not take this well, and responds by transforming into a titan to fight Reiner in an epic battle.

Although Eren fights incredibly well, Berthold and Reiner prepare an attack that takes him by surprise, managing to kidnap Eren and Ymir and flee with them. Eren is immobilized due to the wounds he suffered during the battle with Reiner, and Ymir is reluctant to attack them until she has an advantage over them.

Reiner and Bertholdt bear a grudge against Ymir, who in the past seems to have attacked one of their friends. But they gradually convince her to join their side by offering a safe way out for her and Christa. Although Ymir feels that both Bertholdt and Reiner are somewhat mentally unbalanced due to years of working as double agents, he accepts the offer, and helps them bring Eren back to his hometown.

7. The Coordinate

During Bertholdt, Reiner and Ymir's escape attempt, the cadets decide to pursue them to rescue Eren, encountering many titans roaming the area. During this bloody battle, Erwin Smith loses an arm after offering himself as a distraction, and many other military men are eaten or crushed as they struggle to get close to Eren.

As Mikasa tries to rescue Eren, they discover that they have to face the same grinning titan that killed Eren's mother all those years ago. But Private Hannes tries to save them. Unfortunately, his skills prove insufficient, and he is devoured in a heroic and tragic act. Thinking that his death is inevitable, Mikasa confesses his love for Eren, but the emotions awaken a new ability within him: he can control the titans with a scream.

He uses his abilities to force other titans to kill the grinning titan, and then secures a victory for his friends, despite failing to prevent the escape of Bertholdt, Reiner and Ymir.

On the other hand, in the city, Hange and Conny confirm with Commander Pyxis that the titan invasion did not originate outside the walls, but inside the city of Rakago. This means that no matter how many walls they build, humanity will never be safe from invasion.

And, on the horizon, we see the apparent mastermind behind all these events: the beast titan, promising to stir up more trouble for our heroes.

8. Government conspiracy?

At the beginning of the third season, Levi's group is resting and supporting Eren, who fails to master the ability to create the organic crystal. The reason he feels pressured to do so is because Hange is convinced that it is the only way to effectively seal the hole in the Maria wall.

While this is going on, there is Christa's predicament. The girl decides to use her real name, Historia Reiss, and is having trouble dealing with past events.

On the other hand, there is trouble in the districts: Pastor Nick is brutally murdered, and they make it look like a robbery. However, Hange and Levi discover that it is the first part of a conspiracy created by the military police. The government seems determined to erase any knowledge about the royal blood of History, and about the secrets of the Titans. Furthermore, they are willing to use their influence in the militia to assassinate anyone who gets in the way.

Before the militia manages to wipe out Levi's squad and capture Historia and Eren, our heroes manage to evade them. But before they escape completely, Levi discovers that there is another group looking for the squad. It's a group of expert assassins who have modified the militia's omni-directional devices to work with guns instead of swords.

And not content with that, they are also willing to assassinate people, not titans. Their leader is Kenny the Ripper, who has a curious connection to Levi.

Kenny and his group manage to capture Historia and Eren, leading them to the girl's father, Rod Reiss. Eren is a prisoner, but Historia is surprised to discover that her father seems to want her back with open arms.

At this point in the story we discover a series of story arcs important to the plot. First, King Fritz, who sits on the throne, is a puppet, and Rod Reiss is the true heir to the throne. That translates into Historia being the next heir to the kingdom, but this is only the beginning.

9. History Reiss

To expand the political plot a bit further, we discover that Historia's life has been plagued by misery and loneliness.

Her mother Alma was a servant of Rod Reiss, who was expelled to the camp upon discovering her pregnancy and Historia's birth. Her mother's resentment of her was a mixture of disdain and anger. The first connection Historia has with her mother Alma was once he pushed her and drew blood from her nose, and the poor little girl believes that is the only affection she deserves.

Despite this, there was one positive figure in her life: Frieda, whom she called her sister, who taught her to read and write. Historia never thought it possible to receive such affection. However, after Reid has Alma killed and sends Christa to the militia, Historia lost all memory of Frieda, until she met her father again.

But this was no accident. Frieda had the power to alter people's memories in any way she wished.

This power is inherited by members of the royal family, who pass these talents down through the generations along with the titan's ability. Under the ruins of a family cathedral, Rod leads Historia and Eren to a crystal cavern, where the Reiss family has performed the titan ritual for years.

In order to claim the powers of one bearer from another, the royal successor must consume the predecessor in titan form. Simplifying: Rod has a dose of the serum used to transform into a titan, and Historia must use it to eat the one who has the power of his family.

This is why Eren has been kidnapped along with Historia. Eren is the one who possesses the power of the founding titan thanks to a plan of his father, Grisha Jaeger. Rod intends for Historia to regain his birthright by force.

10. The Ackermann Legacy

Meanwhile, Levi and the rest of the squad are on the run from the law, trying to deal with the knowledge that the monarchy they protect is a sham. Knowing they cannot save Eren and Historia while they are fugitives, Levi talks with Commander Erwin and General Pyxis to put together a near-suicidal plan. The plan is to unite the citizens, overthrow King Fitz, and proclaim Historia as the rightful queen.

Weaving a daring political plan, they succeed in overthrowing the government and Levi and Erwin's allied military leaders take over while Levi and the others continue their journey to rescue the kidnapped.

But complications keep arising. Levi, for his part, has to deal with family issues. It turns out that he and Kenny share the same last name, which is also shared by Mikasa. A series of flashbacks shows us that subway cities existed, and Levi lived with his poor mother, until she succumbed to an illness. Kenny found the starving orphan and raised him to become a cold-blooded killer like himself, as it was the only way to survive underground.

The Ackermanns are not just any killers, their lineage is intertwined with the royal family. Before establishing a feud with the nobility, the Ackermanns were knights and protectors of the crown for generations. It is even implied that this family has superhuman powers, impressive reflexes and strength, which explains why Mikasa, Levi and Kenny are so lethal in battle.

Eventually, Kenny encounters Rod Reiss' younger brother, Uri in his titan form, who nearly kills Kenny . Their partnership would last for decades, and Kenny would become a confidant to the heir to the throne, and the soldiers serving Uri would become part of Kenny's gang.

11. The history of the titans

The good news is that Historia isn't willing to kill her friends, so she restores some sanity to Eren. As Levi's squad assaults the cave and disposes of Kenny's group, Rod Reiss consumes the remainder of the titan serum in desperation. His titan form is gigantic, the largest seen to date. In his transformation, about to crush everyone in the cave, Eren manages to use the ability to produce the organic crystal, protecting his friends. Meanwhile, the giant titan crawls into the Orvud district.

The heroes escape, and perform Historia's succession as queen, while trying to defend Orvud from the enormous threat of Rod Reiss.

Historia decides to ask Erwin to be the one to deliver the coup de grace to the titan Rod, and manages to win the approval of the people with this heroic act. Having restored peace, Eren and the others return to their original plan, which is to seal the hole in the Maria wall forever.

Historia Reiss coronation

After crowning Historia, Eren decides to talk to his former instructor, Keith Shadis. Shadis knew Grisha from his youth, revealing to them that Eren's father came to their village with amnesia, and it took him years to build a reputation as a doctor.

Later, between that timeline and the loss of Wall Maria, Grisha discovered the titan's powers in the Reiss clan. When Carla, Eren's mother, was killed in the titan attack, the power of the founding titan was stolen. Motivated by the misfortune, Grisha wipes out the Reiss but Rod escapes, then injects Eren with the serum to prevent him from falling into the wrong hands.

While dealing with this new information, Levi meets Kenny, who moribundly shows him that he has an injector with the titan serum. At this point a new objective is created, in addition to repairing the wall. They must investigate the secrets left in the Jaeger family basement.

12. The power of the enemy

At the beginning of the new season, we focus entirely on the Maria wall. Levi Squadron arrives with an established plan: to plug the holes on either side.

Using cloaks that protect their identities to hide Eren and with the ability to create the organic crystal, they manage to seal one of the holes, but Armin begins to feel insecure not seeing any Titan inside Shiganshina. Because of this, he begins to think about where the enemy might be hiding. Soon he comes up with the answer: inside the walls. Desperate, he stops the operation, testing his theory and requesting a search squad from Erwin to keep Eren safe.

Erwin, having witnessed the genius of Armin's plans in the past, hands over the chain of command to the boy. Armin, determined but nervous, asks the soldiers to touch the walls of the wall to see if they can find any voids.

His theory proves to be correct when Reiner attacks them from inside the walls of the walls, and catches the squad practically off guard. But soon after, things get even more out of hand with the arrival of the beast titan, who attacks them with a stone, blocking the horses' exit and trapping them inside the wall. But the beast titan is not alone: with him is an apparent army of titans, and the squadron is threatened more than ever.

13. The Battle for Shiganshina

After finding Reiner's hideout, the remaining soldiers of Erwin's squadron try to plan an effective confrontation against the Armored Titan. The reason they are hopeful is because a new series of explosive weapons was created whose power could penetrate Reiner's armor, and with Levi's strategy or Mikasa's skills, they could finally take down the Battleship. However, despite their efforts, their plan is cut short by Bertholdt, who was waiting for a signal from Reiner to attack. Armin tries to mediate with his former partner, but the boy seems determined, and operates against the militia forces.

He transforms into the Colossal Titan, and uses his ability to expel hot air to set fire to the wooden houses inside Shiganshina, blowing up several unsuspecting soldiers. His mission is to wipe out the horses and lock them inside the city, to finish them off once and for all.

However, Erwin, who is on the other side of the wall along with Levi, decides that, instead of defending what is left of his forces, they should concentrate on retrieving the information from Grisha Jaeger's basement, and so he notifies Levi. His second in command asks him if he is planning a suicide mission, and Erwin tells him that his only chance to learn the truth is to find out what is inside that basement.

Finally, Erwin decides to sacrifice himself to create a smoke distraction sufficient to eliminate the Beast Titan's advantageous vision, while Levi must use the Titans surrounding the Beast to take him down. The plan succeeds, until the Chariot Titan appears, who flees with the person behind the Beast Titan after Levi hesitates for a second too long after witnessing the death of almost his entire squad.

14. Armin's sacrifice

On the other hand, inside the walls, Eren and Armin consider how to stop the Colossal Titan. Their companions are decimated, Officer Hange is missing in action and they are out of options, so Armin decides to study Bertholdt's behavior. During his observation, he discovers that the Titan is losing strength and muscle by emanating his heat attack, and comes up with an idea that could end his problems... and his life.

Armin confronts Bertholdt directly, and exhausts his heat attack, giving Eren an opening to attack him through the back of the neck. However, the blond suffers terrible burns during this strategy, and despite the victory, is bitter about his possible demise.

What we didn't expect, is that Levi had an injection that is capable of healing a person on the verge of death, and Eren begs him to use it on Armin. When the commander decides to agree to use it on Armin, the sole survivor of Erwin's suicide attack, he appears with Erwin on his back, badly wounded but still breathing.

15. Levi's decision

For minutes that seemed like forever, Levi had to make the toughest decision of his career: whether to save his mentor Erwin's life or save Armin, who could go down in history as his successor. After a tremendous discussion with Eren and Mikasa about who should receive the injection, Armin is the chosen one. Luckily, they have Bertholdt's presence, which means that Armin, turned Titan, will have to eat the boy to inherit his powers and become the new Colossal Titan.

After losing Reiner and the man behind the Beast Titan thanks to the Chariot Titan, this feels like a bitter victory, but the story has yet to unfold when we finally find out what's inside Grisha Jaeger's basement.

16. The Basement

Finally, our protagonists unveil the mysterious contents of Eren's basement. In it, they find three books belonging to Grisha, and inside one of them, a photograph.

Indeed, a photograph. At first, the military are shocked because they believe it to be an elaborate portrait, but then they discover that there is a civilization beyond what they know and it lies outside the walls and the island that contains them.

Through a seemingly telepathic connection between Eren and the memories of his father produced by his writings, we discover that Grisha unintentionally caused the death of his younger sister. In a dramatically more advanced civilization than we know in the series, we see the distinction of the classes. Grisha and her sister are Eldians. The others, are citizens of Marley, the "great" civilization that seeks to proliferate its beliefs that the Titans are basically the children of Satan.

When Grisha's sister is killed solely for being Eldian, Grisha begins to question everything his father has taught him about humanity, about his past and the origin of the Titans.

In her process of rebelling against Marley, Grisha meets Dina Fritz, direct heiress of the royal family, and together, they have a son, Zeke Jaeger, who we will talk about later.

Another important discovery that comes from Grisha's memories is the impressive connection of his first wife with the Laughing Titan, who devoured Eren's mother. As it turns out, when Dina Fritz and Grisha are exiled from Marley, they are first injected with the formula to become a Titan. When Dina transforms, we can clearly see that she is none other than the Smiling Titan, who murdered Eren's mother and family friend Hannes and was then killed by Eren when he used his coordinate powers.

18. Heirs of Ymir

Apparently, the Eldians are all heirs of a woman who made a pact with a "demon", who gave her the first Titan powers. This is the origin of the Founder Titan mentioned above. Ymir Fritz, the woman in question, used this power to promote prosperity and peace. She cultivated her lands, created roads and bridges, and rapidly advanced this new civilization. After an indeterminate period of time, Ymir passed away and her soul was divided into nine successors, many of the titan/human shifters we already know, the Colossal Titan, Battleship, Female, Chariot, Mandible, and Beast. However, their memories would live on forever thanks to the power of the Founding Titan.

The Eldian Empire was divided into eight houses, each led by one of the nine titans, who were in constant conflict for generations. The Founding Titan, under the power of the Fritz family, was in charge of restoring the balance among the other heirs of Ymir. After conquering much of the land, several nations, such as Marley, created an enormous hatred for Eldia, and desired its annihilation.

It finally disbanded after 1700 years at the end of the Great Titan War, dividing between those who exiled themselves to Paradis Island with King Fritz 145, and those who remained on the mainland to be interned in Marley internment zones.

The Eldians of Paradis Island reside in a large walled territory, seeking protection from the threat posed by the Titans. They are unaware of the existence of the rest of civilization. Here, we come full circle and understand the existence of these humans so backward in their knowledge, as they live in a kind of pre-industrial Germany, whose best and most innovative invention has been the three-dimensional mobility device. The legal measures within the walls and the teaching within the walls, seek the limitation of the advancement and development of civilization.

On this island the belief has been held for generations that they are the only human survivors of the terror of the Titans, when in reality, all humans residing there, at some point may have been Titans.

20. The curse of Ymir

Another important piece of information to note from Attack on Titan season 3 is that whoever inherits the powers of one of the Nine Titans only has 13 years to live. And, if no one devours them, a baby belonging to the race of Ymir's People inherits them once they are born.

And another curious fact, to end the summary of chapters 50-54, is to point out that Eren Kruger, who trapped Grisha Jaeger and gave him the powers of the Titan of Eren, (the Attack Titan) seems to be connected with the Eren of the future, since their memories seem to be intertwined.

21. The truth behind the royal blood
Armin transcribes the details Eren gives him from Grisha's memories, discovering that Eren Kruger had a desire to restore Eldia, which led him to participate in the persecution of his people to maintain his false identity. Kruger then reveals that those who possess the Titan Power live only thirteen years, along with the two means of succession and the nature of the Coordinate, and asks Grisha to infiltrate Paradis and take the Founder Titan from the royal family. Kruger explains his reasons for selecting Grisha while advising him to start a new family before proceeding to inject him with the Titan serum, "incoherently" mentioning Armin and Mikasa.

In the present, Eren and Mikasa are released to participate in the conference between the government. Historia also attends after reading Ymir's farewell letter, glimpsing her friend's memories as a result. With the evidence presented before the council, Hange laments that his enemies now include humans other than Titans, while it is established that Eren could command the Pure Titans despite not being of the royal bloodline. At this point Eren realizes that he commanded the Pure Titans because he touched the form of Dina Fritz's Pure Titan, keeping it a secret for fear of what the military might do to History if he revealed this knowledge.

At the Paradis government meeting, Historia decides that the people inside the walls must know the truth about the Titans just as the Titans' breach of the wall was the beginning of a planned invasion by the Marley state. This information is met with mixed reactions among the populace. When Hitch approaches the survivors at a ceremony to honor their fallen comrades, Floch tells him how heroic Marlo was, and also raises the difficult question of why Armin received the serum instead of Erwin, a controversial decision even among the survivors.

Historia presents the nine survivors with their medals, Eren touches his hand and is immediately flooded with memories of the royal Fritz family, indicating a connection through Titan blood. A year after the attack on the Trost district, the Titans inside Wall Maria were killed and the inhabitants returned to their villages to begin rebuilding and farming. Six years after the fall of the wall, reconnaissance troops, including the survivors, begin expeditions outside the wall again. One day they find a Titan unable to move due to its small arms and legs and realize that they must be near the perimeter wall where Marley turns the Eldians into Titans.
